## 🧑‍🚀 About Me

I'm passionate about quantum technologies, software engineering, and scientific innovation. With hands-on experience in quantum programming and applied research, I thrive in multidisciplinary environments and love tackling new challenges. 
I enjoy building tools and solutions—both in code and hardware—that push the boundaries of what’s possible.
